This repository is an experiment showing what you can do with wasm, rust and webgl, a powerfull 3d rasterization engine.
It's gpu accelerated !

You can build it with `build.sh`. The site will run locally, just type 'http://localhost:8000/' in your browser to test it.

- Prerequisites:
- - The [wasm-pack](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack) toolchain to compile the rust file to webassembly
- - Python 3 with the `http.server` module. Try `pip install http.server` if you don't have it.
